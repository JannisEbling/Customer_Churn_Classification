## I. Problem definition

“Customer Churn” refers to the loss of customers. That is, if a customer or a client stops taking services from a company, it is said that he/she has churned.

Since Churn is intimately connected to a company’s performance, one can analyze customer churn to get insights into the shortcomings of the provided services. Improving on these key shortcomings can persuade customers to stay, which would help the company to make more money.
